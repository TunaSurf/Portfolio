# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website built with React and Next JS 

A few months back I got interested in Next JS because of its simple to set up Server Side Rendering capabilities thinking it could be a good platform to use if I decided to refactor [Should I Shred](https://github.com/TunaSurf/ShouldIShred). While looking through the docs I found that, along with complex applications, Next JS had a simple build/export command for rendering static HTML files. For my portfolio in its current state, a framework like Next JS was absolutely overkill, but it was a good experince building out a website with it as well as Zeit's Style-JSX. Plus I like to think I'm future proofing my efforts a bit if for any reason I decide to include additional back-end functionality to my portfolio.
