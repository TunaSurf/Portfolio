SurfShop is an in-development project venture built with React on the client side and Googleâ€™s Firebase platform on the backend. The application will allow users to share products they wish to sell and find products in their area that they wish to buy from other users. First iterations of the project will focus on creating a classifieds-like experience where the site handles only introducing buyers and sellers; with goals of incorporating e-commerce functionality directly into the site in future iterations.",

This app was designed to be used for quickly gathering relevant surf information for 100's of locations around the US. Project priorities included ease of use to help foster a quick decision as to whether the user should grab their board or not, as well as slick animations for a pleasant experience.\\n Note that reliable tide data was not easily accessible for each location and was therefore deamed beyond the scope of this project. As a result, the tide data displayed for each location is randomly generated on page load.",
