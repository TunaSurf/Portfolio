This app was designed to be used for quickly gathering relevant surf information for 100's of locations around the US. Project priorities included ease of use to help foster a quick decision as to whether the user should grab their board or not, as well as slick animations for a pleasant experience.\\n Note that reliable tide data was not easily accessible for each location and was therefore deamed beyond the scope of this project. As a result, the tide data displayed for each location is randomly generated on page load.",
